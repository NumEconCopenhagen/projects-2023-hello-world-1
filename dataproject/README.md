# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Alcohol Consumption and Life expectency** and is an analysis of the effects of alcohol consumption on life expectancy in the different contries in year 2016. We have gathered data from https://ourworldindata.org/ where we have used the following two datasets: "Share of adults who drank alcohol in last year, 2016" and "life expectancy of women vs life expectancy of men".

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:
 
1. dataX.csv (*source*) 
1. dataY.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
